# Purpose  

Our mission is to empower communities and businesses by helping them take control of their energy
and environmental footprint. By choosing to generate power from non-recycled waste, you can
achieve supply security, cost control, and environmental improvements while reducing dependence
on the grid.
Our projects operate continuously, ensuring uninterrupted energy supply. They enable you to
establish your own energy pricing while providing eco-friendly electricity, biogas, and hydrogen. Our
approach eliminates landfill waste, ocean dumping, and open burning for a greener future.

# Mission

Our innovative digital ecosystem enables you to discover the potential of power generation from
non-recycled waste across various sectors, including agriculture, food services, manufacturing, and
distribution chains. We'll collaborate with you to develop a tailored project.
Our platform streamlines your journey from feasibility to operation by connecting you with essential
partners, such as technology providers, materials analysts, funders, permit specialists, and
construction and operation teams.
No matter the size of your waste output, from thousands of tonnes annually to just a few kilograms
daily, we have a technology solution designed to meet your needs.

# Vision

Our vision is founded on the "6R" principles: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Repurpose, Regenerate, and
Regrowth.
1. Reduce consumption and resource use in our daily lives
1. Reuse items until they no longer serve a purpose
1. Recycle all recyclable materials
1. Repurpose non-recycled waste to generate green energy locally
1. Regenerate our environment by adopting circular models focused on nature, including our
own by-products like organic fertilizers, char, and biochar
1. Regrowth involves fostering an economy that harmonizes our biosphere and financial
ecosystem after applying the first five principles
