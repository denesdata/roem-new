Power generated from non-recycled waste is, in our view, an ideal renewable energy source. Here are
two key reasons:
  1. Unlike solar and wind, it provides continuous power 24/7.
  2.  Using non-recycled waste prevents it from polluting our soil, water, and atmosphere in
uncontrolled ways.

Concerned about costs? Even our larger projects have payback periods under five years, with some
as low as two. After that, you only cover the annual facility maintenance cost, with no grid or
standing charges.  

Our proprietary database features over 150 technology partners using proven technology, and our
goal is to match you with the right one. We see waste as a fuel opportunity â€“ and it's already yours!
We've researched three key technologies: slurry covers, anaerobic digesters, and pyrolysis units.
These can process most non-recycled waste from food, manufacturing, and distribution supply
chains, including animal waste, abattoir waste, food waste, packaging, and plastic.

# Our unique process

We've launched several offline projects to ensure the viability of our digital platform.
Our digital ecosystem offers a comprehensive process that includes:

### Exploration Station

<h2>Exploration Station</h2>

Discover if your waste type is suitable for a project or learn more about
power-from-waste  

### Calculator Tool

<h2>Calculator tool</h2>

Input rough estimates and waste type to receive an initial feasibility
statement outlining potential costs and power outputs

### Fulfilment Hub

<h2>Fulfilment Hub</h2>

Initiate and track your live project, whether it's a simple food waste system
for a restaurant that takes weeks or a complex, large-volume plastic waste project that spans
several months
