- Environmentally friendly
- Low maintenance and long-lasting
- Emissions-free during use

However, there are **drawbacks**:

### Drawbacks  
- High initial costs
- Intermittent power supply, requiring grid connection or battery storage
- Environmental impacts during production and disposal
- Potential local resistance to solar farm installations near habitation
