Wind power, also called "Eolic" energy, generates electricity using wind turbines. It offers several
**benefits**:

### Benefits
- Often cheaper than fossil fuels by 2023
- Environmentally friendly
- Emissions-free during use
- Renewable energy source

However, there are **drawbacks**:
### Drawbacks
- High initial costs
- Intermittent power supply, requiring grid connection or battery storage
- Environmental impacts during production and disposal
- Potential local resistance to wind farm installations near habitation

In conclusion, if it's feasible, wind power is a viable option.
