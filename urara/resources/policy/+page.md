The policy landscape surrounding waste management and renewable energy is constantly evolving,
both locally and globally. From government regulations to public sentiment, there are numerous
factors that impact the way businesses approach power-from-waste projects. Whether you're
operating on a local or global level, it's important to stay up-to-date with the latest policies and
trends in your industry.  
  
Locally in the UK, the government has set ambitious targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions
and increasing the use of renewable energy. The Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) and Contracts for
Difference (CfD) schemes are designed to encourage the development of renewable energy projects,
including power-from-waste initiatives. The UK also has a landfill tax, which incentivizes businesses
to find alternative waste disposal methods, such as power-from-waste.  
  
Globally, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include specific targets for
sustainable waste management and renewable energy. The SDGs call for a significant reduction in
the amount of waste generated worldwide, as well as an increase in the amount of waste that is
recycled or recovered for energy. Additionally, several countries have implemented policies and
regulations to encourage the development of power-from-waste projects, including feed-in tariffs,
carbon pricing, and renewable energy mandates.
